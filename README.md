# Radiometric-Identification
This repository contains the dataset described in the article ["A Novel Approach to Radiometric Identification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02256) by R.R. Nigmatullin, S.V. Dorokhin and A.V. Ivchenko.

It is a binary classification task, the features are generated from the phase of differential signal using [CAPoNeF (Comparative Analysis of POsitive and NEgative fluctuations)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1368/4/042055/meta)
method suggested by R.R. Nigmatullin.

Dataset contains 30000 entries with 10 features described in [the original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02256).
